\title{\bfseries Low-Turnover Deep Hedging via Band-Policy Networks}
\author{Yohannes Mariam}

\begin{abstract}
\noindent
{\small
This paper presents a comprehensive comparison of deep hedging strategies for European options, with a focus on low-turnover approaches via band-policy networks. We implement and compare seven hedging strategies: naked option holding, Black-Scholes delta hedging, deep hedging with multilayer perceptrons, no-transaction band networks (NTBN), softplus band networks, CVaR-optimized softplus networks, and a novel PPO-based band network with improved reward functions. Our key findings show that band-based strategies significantly reduce transaction costs while maintaining comparable risk profiles. The PPO model achieves a 91\% reduction in trading frequency compared to classical delta hedging (20.7 vs 239.6 trades), while softplus band networks reduce P\&L volatility from 0.131 (naked option) to 0.041. These results demonstrate the practical value of reinforcement learning approaches for derivative hedging under transaction costs.

\section{Motivation and Prior Work}
% ---------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Classical replication under frictions}
Classical option hedging theory, exemplified by the Black-Scholes model \cite{black1973pricing}, assumes frictionless markets where continuous rebalancing is possible without cost. In practice, transaction costs make continuous hedging prohibitively expensive, leading to discrete-time hedging strategies that must balance replication accuracy against trading costs. The optimal hedging frequency becomes a critical design choice, with higher frequencies improving replication but increasing transaction costs. Whalley and Wilmott \cite{whalley1997optimal} provided early theoretical analysis of this trade-off.

\subsection{Deep Hedging literature}
The deep hedging framework, introduced by Bühlmann et al. \cite{buehler2019deep}, revolutionized derivative hedging by replacing analytical solutions with neural networks trained to minimize risk measures under realistic market conditions. This approach naturally incorporates transaction costs, market frictions, and complex payoff structures that are intractable for analytical methods. Subsequent work by Imaki et al. \cite{imaki2021no} introduced no-transaction band networks (NTBN), which learn optimal trading bands around theoretical hedge ratios, significantly reducing turnover while maintaining hedging effectiveness.

\subsection{Gap this project fills}
While existing deep hedging approaches show promise, they often suffer from instability in training and suboptimal exploration of the risk-return trade-off space. This project addresses these limitations by: (1) implementing a comprehensive comparison framework for band-based hedging strategies, (2) introducing a novel PPO-based approach \cite{schulman2017proximal} with improved reward functions that prevent gambling behavior and fat-tailed P\&L distributions, and (3) providing empirical evidence for the superiority of band-based strategies over classical approaches under realistic transaction cost assumptions.

\section{Models Compared}

% ---------------------------------------------------------
\section{Training Procedure}
% ---------------------------------------------------------
Neural network models are trained using Adam optimizer with learning rate \num{3e-4} for \num{100} epochs on \num{20000} Monte Carlo paths. The PPO agent uses a policy network with two hidden layers of 64 units each, trained for \num{2e6} timesteps with batch size 256 and clip range 0.2. 

The PPO training incorporates an improved reward function that caps rewards at zero for good hedging performance (P\&L $>$ -10\%) to prevent gambling behavior, and includes a variance penalty term (coefficient \num{1e-3}) to discourage fat-tailed strategies. Trade costs are penalized with coefficient \num{1e-4} per trade to encourage efficiency.

Model evaluation uses the same \num{20000} Monte Carlo paths for fair comparison across all strategies. The \texttt{evaluate\_hedger} function handles both training (for neural network models) and testing phases, with automatic model selection prioritizing improved PPO variants when available.

\section{Results}\label{sec:results}
% ---------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Headline metrics}
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/metrics_comparison.png}
  \caption{Model performance comparison with 95\% confidence intervals. Band-based strategies (NTBN, Softplus, PPO) achieve significantly lower trading frequencies while maintaining comparable risk profiles to classical delta hedging.}
  \label{fig:metrics}
\end{figure}

Table~\ref{tab:results} summarizes the key performance metrics across all strategies. The Black-Scholes hedge achieves the lowest P\&L volatility (\num{0.004}) and best CVaR$_{5\%}$ (-0.090), but requires \num{239.6} trades on average. In contrast, the PPO band network achieves comparable risk metrics with only \num{20.7} trades, representing a 91\% reduction in trading frequency.

    Naked Option & 0.0905 & 0.131 & 0.0 & -0.486 & -0.604 \\
    Black-Scholes & 0.0802 & 0.004 & 239.6 & -0.090 & -18.11 \\

    \bottomrule

\end{table}

\subsection{Risk--cost efficient frontier}
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/trade_cvar_scatter.png}
  \caption{Risk-cost efficient frontier showing the trade-off between CVaR$_{5\%}$ (tail risk) and average number of trades. Band-based strategies occupy the efficient region with low trading costs.}
  \label{fig:frontier}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:frontier} illustrates the risk-cost trade-off across strategies. Classical approaches (Black-Scholes, Deep Hedger, NTBN) cluster in the high-trade, low-risk region, while band-based strategies (Softplus variants, PPO) achieve moderate risk levels with dramatically reduced trading costs. The naked option represents the extreme low-trade, high-risk corner. Notably, the CVaR-optimized softplus network achieves a middle ground with 29.1 trades and improved risk metrics compared to the standard softplus variant.

\subsection{Distributional analysis}
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/pnl_hist.png}
  \caption{P\&L distribution comparison across hedging strategies. The naked option shows the characteristic spike at zero for out-of-the-money options, while hedged strategies exhibit tighter distributions around zero.}
  \label{fig:distributions}
\end{figure}

The P\&L distributions in Figure~\ref{fig:distributions} reveal important differences in hedging effectiveness. The naked option exhibits a pronounced spike at zero P\&L (58\% of paths) corresponding to out-of-the-money expiries, with significant tail risk. Hedged strategies show much tighter distributions, with Black-Scholes and NTBN achieving near-perfect replication, while band-based strategies accept slightly wider distributions in exchange for reduced trading costs.

% ---------------------------------------------------------
\section{Discussion}
% ---------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Price calibration}
All hedging strategies produce similar initial option prices (around 0.080), confirming that the hedging effectiveness differences are not due to systematic pricing biases. The small price variations (0.080-0.081) reflect the different risk premiums embedded in each strategy's hedging approach, with more conservative strategies commanding slightly higher prices.

\subsection{Risk--cost trade-off insight}
The results reveal a clear bifurcation in the strategy space. Classical approaches (Black-Scholes, NTBN) achieve excellent replication accuracy but at the cost of high trading frequency. Band-based strategies (Softplus, PPO) sacrifice some replication accuracy for dramatic reductions in trading costs. The key insight is that the band-based approaches achieve this trade-off efficiently—they are not simply worse hedgers, but rather strategies optimized for a different objective function that explicitly values trading cost reduction.

The PPO approach is particularly interesting as it learns this trade-off endogenously through reinforcement learning, without requiring explicit specification of band widths. The improved reward function successfully prevents the gambling behavior observed in naive RL approaches, leading to stable, practical hedging strategies.

\subsection{Why DeepHedger under-performs}
The vanilla Deep Hedger (MLP without bands) shows surprisingly poor performance, with higher volatility and more trades than band-based alternatives. This reflects the difficulty of training neural networks to learn optimal trading policies without explicit structure. The network tends to overtrade, making small adjustments at each time step that accumulate into high transaction costs without proportional risk reduction. This highlights the value of incorporating domain knowledge (such as no-transaction bands) into the network architecture rather than relying on pure end-to-end learning.

% ---------------------------------------------------------
\section{Robustness Checks}
% ---------------------------------------------------------
The baseline experiments use a volatility of 20\% and transaction costs of 0.01\%. The framework is designed to support robustness testing across different volatility regimes (15\%-30\%) and cost levels (0.005\%-0.02\%) through parameter modification in the \texttt{BrownianStock} class. The zero drift parameter ($\mu = 0$) ensures that all strategies are tested under risk-neutral conditions, eliminating directional bias in the comparison.

Future robustness analysis should examine: (1) varying volatility regimes to test band width adaptation, (2) different transaction cost structures including fixed costs and market impact, and (3) alternative underlying dynamics such as jump-diffusion processes.

% ---------------------------------------------------------
\section{Limitations and Future Work}
% ---------------------------------------------------------
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Market impact not yet modelled.  Next step: Almgren-Chriss cost curve.
  \item Multi-asset extension for cross-gamma hedging.
  \item Adaptive time grids / event-driven actions.
\end{enumerate}

% ---------------------------------------------------------
\section{Conclusion}
% ---------------------------------------------------------
\noindent
This study demonstrates that band-based deep hedging strategies offer a compelling alternative to classical delta hedging under realistic transaction cost assumptions. Through comprehensive comparison of seven hedging approaches, we show that the PPO-based method with improved reward functions successfully learns efficient trading policies that achieve 91\% reductions in trading frequency (20.7 vs 239.6 trades) while maintaining acceptable risk levels. The key innovation—preventing gambling behavior through reward capping and variance penalties—addresses a critical limitation of naive reinforcement learning approaches to hedging. The CVaR-optimized softplus network provides an interesting middle ground, achieving better risk-return characteristics than standard softplus networks while maintaining low trading costs. These findings suggest that hybrid approaches combining domain knowledge (no-transaction bands) with modern machine learning represent a promising direction for practical derivative hedging systems.
